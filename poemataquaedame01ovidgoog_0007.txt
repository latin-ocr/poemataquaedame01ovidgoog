Norsss

Tssrs Selection follows generally the text of Merkel (1866), the
reading of Siebelis being preferred in one or two instances. We
have endeavored to exhibit as far as possible within our limits the

variety of Ovid's style and genius, and especially to preserve the

more interesting biographical hintsof the Amores and the Tristia.
The greater portion of the book is however made up, necessarily,
from the Metamorphoses, of which we heve taken about a third.
By help of the Argument, which is given in full, we aim not merely
to show the connection of the tales and the ingenuity of the transi·
tions‚-necessary to comprehend the poem as a whole‚-but to
put before the reader something like a complete picture of the
Greek mythology3 at least of those narratives which have held
their permanent place in the modern mind and have entered more
or less into every modern literature.

The grammatical references are to Allen and Greenough’s end
Gildersleeve's Latin Grammars.
