Pumrus Ovinius ano was a fashionable poet at Rome
in the reign of the Emperor Augustus, perhaps the most
fashionable after the death of Virgil (n.c.19)and Horace ·
(a. c. 8).

All that is worth knowing about his life is told by himself
in a pleasing poem (Trist iv. ιο), which is given the last in
the present collection. Like most of the literary men of
Rome, he was not a native ol that city,* being born at Sulmo,
in the country of the Peligni, about¹ 90 miles from Rome.
The year of his birth, a c. 43, was that of Cicero’s death

. His father, a man of respectable fortune, removed to Rome
‹- to give his two boys a city education. Here the young poet
was trained in the usual course of rhetoric and oratory, which
he practised with fair success going sofar as to hold some ’
subordinate political offices. His father was quite eamest to
check his desire for a literary career. But the death of his ,
elder brother left him with fortune enough for independence,
and following his own strong bent Ovid became soon one
Ι of the favorite court poets of the brilliant era of Augustus.
After a career of great prosperity, he was suddenly, at the
age of 51, banisbed to Tomi, a town on the shore of the
Black Sea, in the present Bulgaria The cause of his banisb-
rnent can only be guessed from his allusions to the anger of

‘Vngilmanativeofhfantun Horace ofVenosia, CatuhusofVeronaPropertius
of Umbria, Ovid of Sulmo, Cicero of Arpinum, Sallust of Amitemnnr, Livy ol Pata-
vium. Of eminent-ninum thum, only Cant, Louadnuand Tibulluswere born iu
