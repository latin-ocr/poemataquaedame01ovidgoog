2 Introduction to tlte

whose family history or personal adventures became the subject
os tales absolutely devoid os any symbolieal meaning. ln the
system found in the Greek and Roman poets, nature is full os
mythological beings, grouped - as subjects in a monarchy - about
the one celestial or royal-family, which has 113 abode on Mount

¹ Olympus. The King of Heaven, Zeus (Jupiter), with his sister·

queen Hanc (June), is the child oi Knowos (Saturn) or Time,
who again is the son oi oumnos and GA1A (Heaven and Earth),
beyond which imagination did not seek to⁴ go· His brothers are
Posnmon (Neptune) and HABES (Pluto), kings oi the Waters and
os the Inwer World. His sisters are Dnunrrrn (Ceres) and Hnsm
(Vesta), queens os the Harvest and ol the Home. llis sons are
Ammo, god ol Light, Anss (Mars) os Strite, and Hennes
(Mercurmhe Herald. His daughters are Armene (Memno),
Arnnonrrn (Venus), and Arimis (Drimny goddesses os Wis-
dom, ol Love‚ and oi the Chase. These· are the twelve great
divinities (dii nmjores). And about. them, innenrer or remoter
kindred‚ are groupedthe inferior'deities the heroes or demigods,
their children by hall-mortal parentage, and the innumerabis
progeny οἰ fabulous beings inhabiting the kingdoms ot sky,
water, or ..earth ·

The other department os mythology ls that with which this poem
chiefly deals. lt consists of the miracles and advenmres ascribed
to these superhuman persons - a vast held, ln which ancient fancy
rioted as freely as the modern lancy in novels and salty-tales.
Some ol them may possibly be explained -as'a pictoresque way
oi recounting natural phenomena5 or as exaggerated tales oi real
events. But in general· they seem purely fictions os the imagina-
tion. In a very large proportion they take the form ofvmetamor-
plores, that is, transformations 'ot' men or other creatures into
various shapes3 and this feature-gives the subject and the title os
the present poem (see the first lines o'f Book 1.). 11 professes
simply to tell those stories which have in them this element os the
marvellous,-the transformations, particularly, of men into plants
or animals. But as¹ nearly 'all myths introduce some such feature,
first or last, it manages to include nearly all the important ones
with more or less lulness. They are told in a mmbling discursive
way, one story leading to another by the slightest possible link
