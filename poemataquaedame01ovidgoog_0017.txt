With the primitive (fetichistic) notion of a separate life in
every object, and tne human souldiffering in no essential regard
from the life that dwells in things, it was easy to imagine the spirit
of man, beast, or plant as passing from one dwelling to another, for
a longer or shorter stay. Such a mansmigration was, in fact,
taught as a creed by the school of Pythagoras (see Metam. xv.
1-487). But, as against the Hindoo doctrine of nansmigration
into the very life of other animals, the Greeks held to the identity
and continuity of the human soul, which after death had its abode
assigned in the Lower World. The metamorphosis, therefore,
is only an voccasional miracle, not a real metempmchosr's;† it did
not alter essentially the ordinary course of human life, but only
marked the intimate connection between that and the life of
external nature; or, in acertain wild, pictorial way, showed the
workings of human fancy, to account for the first creatlon of plants
and animale, or other striking phenomena of the natural world, -a
clear water-spring ina little island (Arethusa),a mountain ridge
of peculias shape (Atlas), a bird of plaintive note (Philomela), or
a rock weeping with perpetual springs (Niobe).

To give something like system, order, and development to this
world of fable seems to have been a favorite aim of poetical corn-
position with the¹ ancients. This aim is partly religione, and partly
scientific,-if that can be called scientific which only fills with
fancies a void that no science yet exists to fill. Thus the “ Theo·
gony ” of Hesiod groups together the myths relating to the birth
of gods and heroes-*making a sort of pagan “ Genesis ’'—in a
, form partly chronological, partly picturasque and poetical. This

of the Metamorphoses as a connected whole.

l 'llius the princess lo is changed into a heifer (Met. i 611). She retains her hunran
consciousness, deplores the change, and writes her own name on the sand, to inform her
father of it. This is metamorphosis, or change of form. According to the oriental
doctrine tanght by Pythagoras (Met. xv. 459), the beifer in your stall was doubtlees onoc a
human being, perhaps your own mother or sister: it would be wicked to kill her, and
irnpious to eat her flesh. But she bas only a brute conscissionem and simply shares the
