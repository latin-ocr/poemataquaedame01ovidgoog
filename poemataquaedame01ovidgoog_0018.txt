4 Introduction. '

is apparently the first attempt of human thought to deal systemati-
eally with the phenomena os nature-so as, in a manner, to
account sor things - before men were sufficiently free from super·
stition to reject the early iables. The titles of several Greek works
os the same kind are known; 3ηά Virgil, in the Sixth Eclogue,
puts a similar song into 'the mouth ol Silenus.

Any thing like a real belief in these {ables had passed away long
before the time ol Ovid. He was the popular poet os a sensual
and artificial age, who found in these creations ot' ancient lancy
3 group os subjects suited to his graceful, ornate, and marvellously
facile style os narrative, 3ηά who did not hesitate to alter or dress
them up to suit hispurpose. The “ Metamorphoses '¹ -Libri xv.
Metamorphoseon (a Greek genitive)-is the most abundant and
rich collection ol these lables that existe. They are told in a
diffuse, sentimental, often debased way, which contrasts strongly
with the serious meaning that originally belonged to these myths;
but are wonderfully fluent, easy, and melodious in their language‚ and
show a skill of versification which seems never to halt or weary.
The poem begins with the first origin os things from chaos, the
t'our ages of gold, silver, brass, and iron, the deluge, followed by the
graceful and pictoresque version os the tales of gods and heroes,
through a long narrative-ssabout raooo verses in all-ending
with the apotheosis os Caesar, as the sequel oi the tale ol Troy.
The series purports to be chronologicam but the order is olten
arbitrary and the connection forced or affected, as would naturally
be the case with an author res diversrhsimas in rpem unius
corporis colleganum (Quint. iv. 1, 77).

The mythology of Ovid and the other Roman poets was Greek
mythology dressed up in Roman names lt is not necessary to
remind the render that the stories here told related to Zeus,
Athene, Artemis, 3ηά the other members of the Greek Olympus.
and could never have been attributed to the sober abstractions or*
the Roman Pantheon. Nevertheless, in commenting upon Ovid,
it is impossible to avoid making use of the names in the same
sense that he did-the names long familiar in modern litera·
ture, which took thern trom the Romans and not the Greeks.
