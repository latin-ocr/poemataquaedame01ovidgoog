[Or the family of Cadmus, Actaeon, having beheld Diana as
she was'bathing with her nymphs‚ was changed by her into a stag,
and torn in pieces by his own hounds (ΙΙΙ. .r38-252). Semele
became the mother of Bacchus, but was destroyed by the presence
of Jupiter, whom she desired to see clothed with flames and thunder
(25 3-31 5). Tiresias, the Theban seer, is made blind, but endowed

⁰ with prophecy (316-338). The nymph Echo, pining with love of

Narcissus becomes a rock, her voice alone surviving (339-401);
while Narcissus, gazing on his image in a fountain‚ perishes, and
by the water-nymphs is converted to a flower (40²·5¹0)· Pen-
theus, having denied the god Bacchus, and forbidden his solem·
nities, and caused him to be seized, is torn in pieces by Bacchands,
his mother and sisters aiding: Bacchus meanwhile (in the form of
Acaetes) relates the miracle wrought by himself upon a Tyrrhenian
crew, whose ship’s tackle he had converted to serpents, and them-
selves to dolphins (511-733). Three Theban sisters (Minyeides)
likewise refrain from the rites of Bacchus: of whom one relates the
tale of Pyramus and Thisbe (IV. 1-54)].

These young lovers, dwelling in Babylon, had appointed a
meeting at the tomb of king Ninus (35-92). Thisbe, coming
first, is terrified by a lion and so escapes. Pyramus, soon arriving,
finds tracks of the beast and the torn mantle of Thisbe ; and con-
ceiving that she is 'slain, stabs himself with his sword, his blood
reddening the fruit os the mulbeny, at whose foot he lies (93-127).

Thisbe, soon returning‚ finds him dying, and slays herself with the
sword yet warm (128-166).
