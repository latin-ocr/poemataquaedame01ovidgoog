[A second sister tells ol Leucothoe, an eastern pnncess, beloved
by the sun-god, who is by him changed after her burial into the herb
frankincense; 'and of Clytie, who, pining with hopeless love of the
same divinity, becomes asun-flower(1v. 167·270). The third
sister, Leuconoe, tells the fable ol the lountain-nymph Salmacis,
to whose waters was given the power to unmau whosoever might
bathe in them (271-388). But the three sisters, who had despised
the rites oi Bacchus, are themselves· converted into bats (389-

despatched from Tartarus ; so that, while he slays their eldest son,
taking him for a wild beast, lno casts herself with Melicerta into ’
the sea, becoming the sea divinity Leucothea, and her compauions
are changed to stones and birds (416-562). Cadmus and his wife
Hermione, in great age, having witnessed these sorrows ol their
house, are at length converted into serpents, consoled only by the
glories of their grandson Bacchus (563-614).]

to a cliff to be devoured by a sea-monster, which he attacks and
slays, and so wius Andromeda sor his bride (663-739). The
