[Ar the marriage feast of Perseus and Andromeda, her uncle
Phineus, to whom she had been betrothed, out of jealousy caused
a quarrel among the guests3 and a violent quarrel arising thence,
with bloodshed on both sides, Perseus, by showing the Gorgon‘s
head, suddenly turned into stone Phineus himself with two hundred
of his companions (V, 1-235). And by the same means, after his
return to Argos, his enemies Proetus and Polydectes were likewise
converted into stone (236-249). Minerva (who had attended Per·
seus thus far), coming to Helicon and inquiringof the Muses, is
told the following: that having taken refuge trom a tempest with
Pyreneus of Daulia, in Phocis, and he offering them violence, they
were changed to birds; and he, attempting flight after them, was
dashed in pleces (250-293). The Pierides, daughters of king
Pierus, of Macedonia, having challenged them to a trial of skill,
begin with the tale of the .glant·sons of Earth, who attempted to
scale Olympus; the terror of the gods before Typhoeus, and the
various shapes they assumed in their flight; to which the Muses
respond by relating the Wandering of Ceres in her search for her
daughter Proserpine (294-340).]

When-the monster Typhoeus had been buried heneath Mount
AEtna, Pluto, god of the world below, alarmed at'the convulsions ·
caused by his agony, came forth to view. Now Venus had been
jealous at the virginity of Proserpine, Ceres’ daughter, and at her
hidding Cupid shot the king of Shadows with his dart. lle then,
beholding Proserpine, as she sported with her maidens in the vale
of Enna, seized her, and bore her away in his chariot, driving his
way through the fount of Cyane, who thereon was herself con-
verted into water (341-437). Seeking her daughter in vain, by the
light of torches kindled from AEtna, Ceres turned into a spotted
lizard (stellio) the boy Stelles, who had mocked her eager thirst;
and into a horned owl Ascalaphus, who testified to having seen
Proserpine in Hades eat seven pomegranate-seeds whereby she
was compelled to remain in her new abode. Meanwhile, the
virgin-companions os Proserpine became winged Sirens. And,
by favor of Jupiter, Proserpine was permitted to pass half the year
with her mother, and half with her wedded iord (438-567).
