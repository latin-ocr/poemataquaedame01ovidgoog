[Terra doom of Niobe reminds one hearer of the wengeance
inflicted on certain people of Lycia, who, having refused to latona
⁴ a draught of water from the lake in her extreme thirst, were by

Jupiter turned into frogs (Vl.· 313-381); and another of the satyr
Marsyas, wh0 was conquered in music and flayed by Apollo; and
another of the crime ol Tantalus, Niobe's father, who caused his
son Pelops tolbe served up at meat to the gods (yda-411). Pan·
dion of Athens, attacked for refusing the friendship of Pelops, is
' helped by Tereus, king of Thrace, to whom he gives his daughter
Progne to wife. But Tereus, having committed incest with
Progne's sister Philomelio dreadfully menged by the two, who
serve tobim in a banquet the body ol his son Itys ς and, pursuing
them for wengeance, all are transformed to birds- Tereus becom-
' inga hoopod‚ Progne a swallow, Philomel a nightingale, and ltys
a pheasant; while Pandion, dying of grief, is succeeded by Erec·
theus (412-676), whose daughter Orithyia is borne away by Boreas
ξ (the North Wind) to Thrace. Here she becomes mother of the
winged heroes Zethes and Calais, who accompany Jason and the
Argonauts in their voyage for tbe Golden Fleece (677-721).]

Arrived at Colchis, Jason is met by the enchantress Medea,
daughter of king Aetes3 who, mowed by love, secures him by her
enchantments from the Dragon guarding the deece, and from the
rire-breathing bulis, with which he ploughs the appointed field,
sowing it with serpents’ teeth (V ΙΙ. 1-122). From these spring up
armed men, who prepare to attack Jason; but he, instructed by
Medea, casts a stone among them, whereat they perish in mutual
slnuglrter (ιη-143). Retuming to lolchos with Medea, he en-
treats her to restore to youth his aged father. The magic is
described at length, by which she prepares the juices of miraculous
herbs; and, these proving efficacious, AEson is converted to the
fresh vigor of forty years before (144-293).
