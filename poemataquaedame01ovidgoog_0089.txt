[Book V111·-¹52-259·]

[Dncnrvrwo the daughters ot' Pelias, Jason‘s enemy, by a
similar miracle wrought upon an aged ram, Medea brings about
their father's death (Vll. 297-349). Escaping by means os winged
dragous, and passing over the scene of many transformatione,
' Medea comes to Athens3 whence (her attempted poisoning oi
Theseus being loiled by the recognition of his father AEgeus) she
suddenly vanishes (350-424). A feast is celebrated in honoros
Theseus' exploits ; and hostility ensuing with Minos (Europa's son)
of Crete, Cephalus is sent as envoy to AEgina; to whom the aged
AEacus relates the marvellous transformation of ants to men (called
Myrmidons)‚ after his realm had been ravaged by pestilence (425-
660). Now Cephalus had received from his wit'e Procris a hound
’ and a dart that never missed its aim3 and, as he delighted greatly
in hunting‚ Procris being jealous watched him from a thicket; and
lre, taking it tor the movement ol some wild creature, shot her with
that dart which was her own gift (661-865). Minos, making war

⁴ on Athens to avenge the slaying of his son Androgeos, comes tirst

to Megara; where Scylla, daughter ot' the king Nisus, out ol love
for Minos cuts the purple lock on which her lather's kingdom and
lile depend. Disdained by Minos, she is changed to a sea-mew,
and Nisus to an osprey (VIII. 1-t 51).]

Theseus, in his escape from the Cretan labyrinth, had borne
' away Ariadne, daughter ol Minos; who, lorsaken by him, is corn-
lorted by Bacchus, who sets her coronet among the stars (152-182).
Daedalus, builder os the labyrinth, being imprisoned, escapes with
his son Icarus by means ol wings fastened with wax; but lcarm,
soaring too near the sun, and the wax melting, falls into the sea
named for him (183-234). His sall is gladly seen by Perdix, once
⁸ sister's son to Daedalus, and slain by him out of cury, but changed
by Minerva to a partridge (235-259)·

OTA Jovi Minos taurorum corpora centum

solvit, ut, egressus ratibus, Curetida terram
contigit, et spoliis decorata est regia lixis.
’· creverat opprobrium generis, foedumque patebat ¹55
matris adulterium monstri novitate biformis.
