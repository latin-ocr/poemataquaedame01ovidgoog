x 7.] Orpheus and Eurydice.

XIV. Onrueus Ano Euareten.
. [Boon X.·-,1-77.]

[Ancaeus mother oi Hercules, to entertain Iole (who had
married his son Hyllus), relates the taleni Hercules’ birth, which
was long delayed, but at last brought about by the artifice oi Galan-
this, a waiting maid; who, for the falsehood she told, was turned
into a weasel by ilithyia, whom she had deceived (IX. 273-323).
Iole relates in turn oi her sister Dryope, changed to a lotus
(324-339). The restoring oi Iolaus to youth, and the miraculous
manhood bestowed on the children oi Callirhoe, having moved the
displeasure of some oi the gods, Jupiter reminds thern of the pain·
sul old age of his own son Minos (400-442). The tale is told ol
Byblis, daughter oi Miletus (who had migrated from Crete to Asia) :
she, filled with a guilty love for her brother Caunus, became a loun-

tain in Curium-665). lphis, daughter of Ligdus os Crete, having Ι ·

been brought up as ayouth to avoid her lather's displeasure thala
daughter was born to him, was at length changed to a young man
by Isis, and so became the husband ol lanthe (666-797).]

Hymen, proceeding to Thrace, aiter the marriage oi lphis,
unites Orpheus to Eurydice, but not happily, lor she died from the
bite ol a serpent. To recover her, Orpheus penetrated the shadows
of the Lower world, where even the F uries are moved to tears at
his song, the patus of hell are stayed, and Proserpine is won to
yield hirn back his wife, only on condition that hc shall not look
behind him till again in the upper world. Turning about too soon,
in his eagerness to see her, he loses her again, and is not suffered
a second nme to enter Hades (Χ. 1-77).

INDE per immensum croceo velatus amictu

aethera digreditur, Ciconumque Hymenaeus ad

oras

tendit, et Orphea nequiquam voce vocatur.
adluit ilie quidem; sed nec sollemnia verba',
nec laetos vultus, nec felix attulit omen. 5
sax quoque, quarn tenuit, lacrimoso stridula fumo
usque suit, nullosque invenit motibus ignes.
