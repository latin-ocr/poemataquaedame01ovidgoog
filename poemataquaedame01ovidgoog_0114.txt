XV. Tua Sorte on anunus.
[Boon X··⁸⁶·²¹9]

Wrruuttawu apartfrom the love of women, and having
gathered by his song a grove of forest trees [among them the pine
which was once the youth Attis, and Cyparissus changed by Apollo
into a CypressJ, Orpheus sings of the loves of the gods for mortal
Ι men. And first of Ganymede of Troy, borneto heaven by aniter
in the form of an eagle (143-161) 3 and of Hyacinthus, a beautiful
youth of Sparta, beloved by Apollo, but accidentally killed by him
with a discus (or quoit) that he had hurled into the air3 from
whose blood sprang the flower that bears his name (162-219). “

[He further sings of certain people of Cyprus, cruel tn
strangers, who by Venus were changed to oxen (220-237); of the
statue wrought by Pygmalion, which became aliving maiden‚ and
his bride (243-297) ; of Myrrha, who because of her incestuous love
of her father became a tree weeping fragrant gum (298-502); of her
child Adonis, loved by Venus (503-5 59) ; of Atalanta, fleet of foot,
who was won in the race by craft of Hippomenes with three goltlen
apples, but both were afterwards changed into lions (560-707);
and of the death of Adonis, slain by a wild boar, and by Venus
converted into the flower Anemone, as Menthe had aforetime been

by Proserpine into the herb Mint (708-739).]

COLLIS erat, collemque super planissima campi
area, quam viridem faciebant graminis herbae.

umbra loco deerat: ·qua postquam parte resedit

dis genitus vates, et fila sonantia movit,

umbra loco venit. Non Chaonis afuit arbor, 90

non nemus Heliadum, non frondibus aesculus altis,
