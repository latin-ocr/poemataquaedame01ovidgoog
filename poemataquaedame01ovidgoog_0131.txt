[As the chiefs marvel at this prodigy, Nestor relates of Caeueus,
once a maideu (Caenis), but made into an invulnerable man, who
was present when the nuptial feast of Pirithous and Hippodamia
wasdisturbed by the battle of the Lapithae and the Centaurs. F or
the Centaurs, monsters· of vast strength and fury, half-man, half-
horse, had attempted to steal away the bride. And Caeneus,
remaining unhurt through the fight, was at length overwhelmed
with vast piles of trees, aud transformed by Neptune to an eagle
(Xll. ¹4⁶·535l· The son of Hercules, Tlepolemus, tells also of
Periclymenus, slain by Hercules as he flew against him ln the form
of an eagle (536-579). At the request of Neptune, whose son
Cygnus had been slain, Apollo guides the arrow of Paris to the
vulnerable beel of Achilles3 so that he dies, and a strife arises
among the other chiefs who shall receive his armor, the rival
claimarus being Ajax and Ulysses (580-628).]

Ajax maintains his claim, before the assembled chiefs, first as of
nobler descent, aud then by his martial exploits, chiefly the defence
of the Grecian fleet; at the same time scorniug the strategy of
Ulysses‚ and asserting that himself alone has might to wield the
immortal armour (1-122). To which Ulysses replies, that his own
oounsel had been most effective iu the siege, and his own acts most
essential, especially in the night attack of the teuts of Rhesus, an'd
the carrying away of the Palladium (123-381). To him the victory
is judged3 and Aiax, in ungovernable wrath, slays himself with
his own sword-the flower hyacinth springing from his blood

(382-398)·

ONSEDERE duces, et vulgi stante corona
surgit ad hos clipei dominus septemplicis Ajax.
utque erat impatiens irae, Sigeia torvo
litora respexit, classemque in litore vultu,
intendensque manus, ‘ Agimus, pro Juppiter l ’ inquit 5
⁴ ante rates causam, et mecum confertur Ulixesl
at non Hectoreis dubitavit cedere flammis,
