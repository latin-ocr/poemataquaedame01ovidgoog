[Dumrto the return of the chiefs from Troy, Hecuba, having
plncked ont the eyes of Polymestor‚ king of Thoece, who had
murdered her son Polydorus, is changed to a dog (Xlll. 399-57 5).
Aurora, mourning for her son Memnon, slain by Achilles, obtains
that his ashes shall become birds, while her tears are changed to
dew (576-622). AEneas at Delphi'is told'by Anius, priest of
Apollo, of his daughters’ transformation into doves while fleeing
from the power of Agamemnon (623-674); and at his departing
receives from him a bowl engraved with the selfdevotion of Orion's
daughters, sacrificed for Thebes, out of whose ashes sprang the
youths Corona (675-699). Thence sailing to Crete and Italy, he
passes at Actium the stone image of the judge Ambracus, and
Dodona where the sons of Molossus took the form o'f birds
(700-718). On the coast of Sicily he nears the rock of the
monster Scylla, once the beautiful daughter of Phorcus, who hears
from her attendant nymph Galatea (daughter of Nereus and Doris)
the following tale (719—749).]

Acis, son· of F annus and the nymph Symaethis‚ the most beau·
titul youth of Sicily, loved and was loved by Galatea. But the
giant Polyphemus had likewise conceiveda wild passion for her,
which he utters in song (750-869); and seeing them as they are
seated together in a wood, he is filled with jealou'sy, and casts a
rock from AEtna upon them, by which Acis is crushed, and his
blood, oozing benearh the rock, becomes a river (870-897).

[Thereafter, as Scylla paces the shore, she is seen and pursued
by Glaucus, who relates to her the story of his own transformation
from a mortal to a sea-divinity (898·968). Going then to Circe, a
mistress of enchantments, he entreats her to aid his suit of Scylla3
but she in jealousy, because she herself loved Glaucus, so en-
chanted the waters Scylla used to bathe, that she was converted to
a foui monster, girt about the loins with wild dogs‚ and afterwards
(lest she might harm AEneas' fleet) to a roclr (XIV. 1-74).]

ACIS erat Fauno nymphaque Symaethide cretus,
magna quidem patrisque sui matrisque voluptas,
nostra tamen major, uam me sibi junxerat uni.
