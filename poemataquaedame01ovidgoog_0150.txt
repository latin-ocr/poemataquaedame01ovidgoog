[AEnnns had passed, on the coast of Italy, the isle of the Cer·
copes, turned by Jupiter into apes (xlv. 75-100), and coming to
Cumae, finds the Sibyl Amalthea, daughter of Scylla, who relates
that, being loved by Apollo, he had granted her wish to live so
many years as the grains of saud in her hand (ror-153). Arriving
at Cajetas, he meets Macareus, an old companion of Ulysses, who
relates the adventure of the Cyclops and the enchantments of
Circe, at whose palace they had remained a full year (154-312).
During this time, Circe tells of Picus, son of Satura, whom, not
returning her love, she had converted to a woodpeclrer‚ and his
compaciens to various beasts, while his wife Canens wasted into

Latium, Diomed refuses aid to Turnus, but his companions‚ desir-

is accused, but acquitted, the black lots being changed by miracle
to white in the urn (XV. 1-59)]. At Heraclea Pythagoras, exiled
from Samos, instructa him in the doctrine of metempsychosis,
and the law which forbids all shedding of blood. This was
unknown in the golden age, but began with the slaughter of
animals for food (75-142). Pythagoras - recalling his own former
existence as Euphorbas (slain by Menelaus before Troy)-teaches
that all life incessantly passes from one to another form; all things
are in flux and change - the heavenly bodies, the seasons types of
human life, the elements with their transmutations, the vast changes
on the face of the earth (237-277). [These changes detailed:

from maimand, and plains uplifted into hills; springs alternately
