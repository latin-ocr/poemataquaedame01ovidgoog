SHORTER POEMS.

1. Tun Fnsrr. ’

Tus word fasti, properly applied to those days of the year on
which it was permitted (far) to transact public business, came to
be applied to the Roman Calendar‚ or systematic arrangement
and classitication of the days of each montb. Ovid’s purpose in
this poem was ιο cast this calendar into a poetic form, describ·
ing whatever was peculiar and characteristic in tbe Roman usages,
-as festivals and rites,-and working into it whatever traditione
and myths were current among the people. The Roman religion
was so meagre in tbe elementa of fable, that its mythology, as pre·
sented in this work, is hardly more than a clumsy adaptation and
vamping over of Grecian myths. It-was, however, as rich in
form and ceremonial as it was poor in story; and the most valu·
able and original portions of the Fasti are those which describe
fragments of these primitive rites, which had managed to survive
tbe inroad of the more fasbionable Greek and Oriental forms of
worship, and still lingered in the community. Some of them,
indeed, held their own for centuries longer, and some were
transformed and adopted into the Christian calendar.

Only six books of the Fasti, containing the months from Jan·
uary ιο June inclusive, are extant. lt is a much disputed question
whether the other six books have been lost, or were never written.
lt is probable that they'were written in tbe rough‚ but unfinished
at the time of the poet's exile, and never published. Αι any rate,
there are no citations in ancient authors from any but the first
six books.

The following extracts frorn the fourth book (Aprss) contain a
description of two very ancient festivals, with the traditional

, account of the founding of Rome, introduced in the usual manner

or the poet.
1. The Festival os Pales (April 21).

ΟΧ abiit, oriturque Aurora. Parilia posoore
Non poscor frustra, si favet alma Pales.
