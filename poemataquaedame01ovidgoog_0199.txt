Ῐτ is supposed that most classes who read Ovid at all, will read
Ovid before any other Latin poet; and as it is desirable that a
poetical composition should always be read as verse, -tbat is, with
a knowledge of· its rhythmical structure,- a few directions will
here be given for scanning at sight, or by ear 3 which, with a little
practice, will be found au easy, almost mechanical process.

lt is necessary, first, for the leamer to understand the nature
of the verse, as depending on precisely the same principles as the
rhythmical divisions of a piece of music (ξ ⁷7); also, to be familiar·
with the general rules of Quantity and Accent (ξς 3, 4)] Besides
this, the teacher should explain and illustrate, so far as may be
necessary, the structure of the hexameter (5 82, a), reading from
the textos the poem it'self, until its peculiar movement has become
familiar to the 'ieamer's ear. lt will now be observed-

r. That the difficulties in scanning lie almost entirely in the
first half of the verse. With very rare exceptions, the last two
feet, and generally tbe last three, are accented in verse exactly as
they would be in prose: that is, the Arses (first syllable) of the
foot corresponds with the natural or prose accent of the w'ord.

2. That in hexameter verse the third soot (rarely the fourth
instead) regularly begins with tlte last syllable of a word. Thus,

x while the last half of averse is almost always accented as in prose,

the first half very seldom is. The slight pause interrupting the
' foot at the end of the word is called a coesural pause (ἓ 79, 5);
and is the most important point that distinguishes the movement
of verse from that of prose. The pause in the third foot (less
commonly the fourth) usually corresponds with a pause in the
sense, and is called the principal caesura. -

arhat whenever a short syllable occurs in the verse, there
must be a dactyl. This becomes a most convenient ruis, as soon
as the pronunciation of even the communest words is known, in

⁸ To these it may be well to add the quantity of final syllables (d 78, a). The
hanes should also be habituzted to un assume pronunciation of words according to their
prose secent.
