all cases where there are words of more than two syllables ; for
thus a short syllable will often serve as a key to the entire structure
of the verse.
For examples, we will take the first four lines of the poem.
1. In novaserl Animus mutdtas dicere formas.
Here the last three words are scanned exactly as they read:
mujtatas Ι dicere Ι formas. Of the others, Animus shows by its
arcent that the i of the penult is short; and, as its last syllable
must belong to the following foot, nothing more is needed to show
that the verse will scan as follows :-
In nova Ι fert antimus Ι multatas Ι dicire Ι formas;
and the quantity of the other syllables is shown at once by their
position in the verse.
2. Corpora: Di, coeptr's- nom vos mutastis el illas-
The first word corporo, being a dactyl, at once gives a correct start to
the verse. The second foot, Dicoep--is equally plain, asaspondee3
and after this beginning, the rest of the verse scans of itself ε -
Corpora: Ι Ι)ἰ, coepitis Ι -nam Ι vos militastis et Ι illas.
3. Α aspirare mem primaque ab origine mundi.
'l’he first word, adspirate, is nearly as clear, as, when we remember
either the pronunciatieu of adsplro or the quantity of the a of the
first conjugation, we see that it contains three long syllables, a
spondee and the beginning of a dactyl. The last three feet are
pronounced exactly as in prose (observing the elision) : -
Adspihate melis 3 Ι priimaqu’ ab diriglne Ι mundi.
4 Ad mea perpltuum deddcr'le llmpora carmen.
Here the three last words form a perfect metrical series; and the
only difficulty in the verse is caused by the ictns coming on the
first syllable of perpetuum, while the accent is on the second.
Ad mea Ι perpethlum Ι detdncrte Ι tempora Ι carmen.
These directions would be sufficient for all or nearly all cases,*
if it were not for the frequent elision of the last syllable of words:
viz, in general, wltonever a word ending in a vowel or in m is
followed ly a word beginning wilh a vowel or wilh ln. This
makes the commonest and most annoying of the obstacles to be
met, and requires the beginner to be constantly on the wateh.v If
he will now earefully compare the following lines, as metrically
divided, with the rules which have been given above, it is hoped
that he will have little difficulty hereafter. ,

⁸ It will be observed thar, of the first twenty verses of the poem, only the eth and 13tb
laek the oesura in the third foot ι while in the rbtb,18th,and roth the principal pause is
in the north root imread ot the third
