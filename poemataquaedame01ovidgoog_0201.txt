Ante malr’ et terlras Ι et Ι quod tegit Ι omnia Ι caelum, s
Unus elrat totto Ι nalturae Ι vultus in Ι orbe,
Quem dixlere Chalos: Ι rudis Ι indligestaque Ι moles,
Nec quiclquam nisi Ι pondus iniere, ΙΙ conigestaqu’ elodem
Non bene Ι junctalrum Ι dislcordia Ι semina Ι rerum.
Nullus adlhuc mnntdo Ι praelbebat Ι lumina Ι Titan, 10
Nec nova Ι crescenldo Ι repalrabat Ι cornua Ι Phoebe,
N ec ciricumtulso Ι penidebat in Ι aere Ι Tellus
Ponderilbus lilbrata sulis, Ι nec Ι brachia Ι longo

Quaque sulit tebius, Ι illlic et Ι pontus et Ι aer. ις
Sic erat Ι instabiilis temus, Ι inlnabilis Ι unda,
Lucis eigens aier3 Ι nullli sua Ι forma mainebat,
Obstalbatqu' alilis aliiud, Ι quia Ι corpor’ in Ι uno
Frigida Ι pugnalbant caliidis, ΙΙ hulmentia Ι siccis,
Mollia Ι cum dulcis, Ι sine Ι ponder' halbentia Ι pondus. 20
